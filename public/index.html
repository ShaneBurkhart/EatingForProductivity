Even after fixing my sleep schedule to get a solid 8 hours a night at consistent sleep and wake times, I still found myself getting tired and losing focus after lunch.</p><p>After doing some research, I noticed what you eat matters as much as when you eat it.</p><h3>I Needed to Find an Expert</h3><p>I can't claim to be an expert on nutrition so I went looking for one.  I found a nutritionist who creates weekly meal plans focused around holistic eating and I asked her if she could help me.</p><p>She sent me my plan for a weeks worth of meals and snacks, along with a grocery list.  Not only was everything delicious, but after a few days, I no longer had trouble staying focused in the afternoon.</p><p class="bold">This was a game changer!</p><img src="/assets/images/people-working-at-a-single-desk.jpg"><p>Now I have high energy throughout my day, eat a well balanced diet that is delicious, and have no trouble maintaining a healthy weight.</p><p><span class="bold">Best of all, I don't have to think about my food for the week at all!&nbsp;</span>My meals and snacks are set for the week and I receive a simple list for grocery shopping.</p><h3>Eat for Productivity Without Thinking About It!</h3><p>I am continuing my meal plan and am working with her to create a reasonably priced service that sends you weekly meal plans designed for sustained energy throughout your day.  We're thinking just a few dollars a month.</p><p>You may think these meal plans won't be customized enough for your lifestyle and if you have dietary restrictions then you would be right!</p><p>But as far personalization on the meal plans I received, there is nothing particularly unique to my life besides the desire to have high energy days with laser focus.&nbsp;<span class="bold">These meal plans will boost your energy assuming you don't have dietary restrictions.</span></p><img src="/assets/images/punch-today-in-the-face.jpg"><h3>Punch Today In the Face.</h3><p>If you catch yourself falling asleep around 3pm and instead want the energy to power through your afternoon, this service will set you up for success&nbsp;<span class="bold">without you having to even think about it.</span></p><p>Enter your email below to receive updates and get notified when we launch :)</p></div></div></div><div class="section red small"><div class="content-upgrade signup-form"><h3 class="bold text-center">Get notified when we launch!</h3><p>We'll let you know when we launch so you can make every day as productive as possible without having to think about the food you eat!</p><form class="ui form" id="email-form" action="http://ref.loveyourbigdog.com/users/create" method="post"><div class="form-wrap"><input class="email" type="text" name="user[email]" placeholder="Enter your email :)"><input class="g-recaptcha submit" name="commit" type="submit" value="Let's eat!" data-sitekey="6LcsSlsUAAAAAC07KUDKpdwqa42lig6dYuvPHAgN" data-callback="onSubmit"></div><script>function onSubmit(token) {
